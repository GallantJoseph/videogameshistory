                        Sega entered the home console market with the Sega Master System in 1985, 
                        followed by the Sega Genesis in 1988, which became a major competitor to 
                        Nintendo's systems in the U.S. and established franchises like Sonic the Hedgehog.

                        The 1990s saw intense competition, culminating in the release of the Sega Saturn in 1994 
                        and the Dreamcast in 1998. However, the Saturn's rushed launch and the Dreamcast's inability 
                        to compete with the PlayStation led to financial difficulties.

                        In the early 2000s, Sega shifted focus from hardware to software development,
